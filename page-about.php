                        <p>Hey there, reader! I’m Ana Hurt. This is my second year at both the University of Nevada and Insight Magazine, and let me just say that I’m super happy with both. Coming from California, the cold took a bit of getting used to, but being able to explore a range of topics as a writer and working with a bunch of crazy talented people as a copy editor for Insight has been inspiring. Hopefully, this issue inspires you, too!</p>
